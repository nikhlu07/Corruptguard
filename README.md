## 🔍 Fraud Detection Engine

Our AI system identifies corruption through 10 sophisticated detection rules:

### Core Detection Algorithms

| Rule | Description | Accuracy | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Budget Anomalies** | Unusual spending patterns vs. historical data | 92% | Sudden 300% cost increase |
| **Vendor Collusion** | Suspicious bidding behavior analysis | 88% | Identical bid patterns |
| **Invoice Manipulation** | Price/quantity discrepancy detection | 90% | Unit costs 5x market rate |
| **Timeline Violations** | Unrealistic project schedule analysis | 85% | 3-year project in 6 months |
| **Quality Deviations** | Material specification changes | 89% | Grade A specified, Grade C delivered |
| **Payment Irregularities** | Unusual payment pattern detection | 87% | Payments before delivery |
| **Document Inconsistencies** | Cross-reference verification | 91% | Mismatched signatures/dates |
| **Duplicate Claims** | Multiple claims for identical work | 95% | Same work billed twice |
| **Ghost Projects** | Non-existent project funding | 94% | Payments with no deliverables |
| **Cost Inflation** | Market rate comparison analysis | 86% | 200% above market prices |

### Machine Learning Pipeline

```python
# Simplified fraud detection workflow
def detect_fraud(transaction):
    # Feature extraction
    features = extract_features(transaction)
    
    # ML model prediction
    anomaly_score = isolation_forest.decision_function([features])
    
    # Rule-based validation
    rule_violations = check_business_rules(transaction)
    
    # Risk score calculation
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(anomaly_score, rule_violations)
    
    return {
        'risk_score': risk_score,
        'is_fraudulent': risk_score > FRAUD_THRESHOLD,
        'violated_rules': rule_violations,
        'confidence': calculate_confidence(anomaly_score)
    }
```

## 💡 Final Message

**"Technology alone cannot eliminate corruption, but it can make corruption so difficult, transparent, and risky that honest governance becomes the only viable option."**

CorruptGuard represents more than code—it's a movement toward a future where public resources reach the people they're meant to serve. Every feature we build, every fraud we prevent, and every transparency tool we create honors the memory of those lost to corruption.

**Join us in building a more transparent, accountable world. One transaction at a time.** 🛡️
